  <br/><br/>
After registering, the user will be redirected to the homepage. 
After signing in, the user will be redirected to the dashboard.
After signing in, the sign-in button at the top of the page will disappear, and the following options will appear instead:

  <br/><br/>


Go to the dashboard: this will take the user to the dashboard page. Dashboard is where the user can choose a nickname to be publicly shown to other users or choose to use the name that they signed up with. We will talk more about what happens after the dashboard in the Video Call Dashboard section.

<br/><br/>

##Video Call Dashboard
After the user reaches the Dashboard, they will have two options to start using PlayGround:
use their own name that they signed up with. 
By entering a nickname into the form field and clicking on the ‘Set Nickname’ button, they can start using PlayGround with an alias of their choice. This nickname will be publicly shown to other online users on the website.
By leaving the form field empty and clicking on the orange ‘Use Your Name’ button, the user will be able to start using PlayGround with the name they originally signed up on PlayGround with. 
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>


The local media stream, which contains the Jane, the local user’s video and audio stream will appear on the direct call section, on the right side of the page. If it is the user’s first time on the platform, the user’s browser will notify the user of the website’s attempt to use the camera and microphone.

The user is informed that they need to choose a friend from the Active User List to start a new PlayGround. The active users will be displayed at the bottom of this page. 

<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

By clicking on one of these active users, you will initiate a call request. At this time, the user will see the text ‘Calling…’ appear below their video screen.

Jack, our remote user, will be notified that Jane is calling.

<br/><br/>
  
Jack now has the option to Accept or Reject Jane’s call. 
If rejected, the connection will not be initiated and Jane will also be notified that the call was rejected.

If Accepted, a second video stream will appear for both users, which will contain the remote user’s video and audio streams.

<br/><br/>
##Read 
Read is a library activity in which the users will start reading books together. By clicking on the activity icon a list of books, identified by their names and covers will appear that the users can choose from. If a book is chosen for one client, the same will be opened for the other client.  As one user flips the page, the same page is flipped for the other user. At the moment, the library consists of only one book. But more can easily be added.

Each page of a book consists of an image, a paragraph of text, a previous button, and a next button, which will take the users to the previous and next pages, respectively.
